I did already start <a href="https://mchlol.github.io/recipes/" target="_blank">a recipes website</a>. But since I've committed to do the whole Odin Project Foundations course, I have to go back and do the updated HTML & CSS lessons. Although it's covering things I already learned, and it means it will take me longer to finish, it can't hurt to get in a little more practice.

(Also turns out I <em>am</em> into brutalist web design.)

One thing I haven't done is create a website - that is, more than one page. So I'll be doing that here.
